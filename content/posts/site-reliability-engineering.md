## What is Site Reliability Engineering?

Site Reliability Engineering is what happens when you ask a software engineer to do operations.

In general, an SRE team is responsible for availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, security, and capacity planning.

First and foremost, SREs are engineers. We apply the principles of computer science and engineering to the design and development of computing systems: generally, large distributed ones.
