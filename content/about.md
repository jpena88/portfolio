I am a Site Reliability Engineer with over 10 years of experience doing lots of different things & solving many complex problems. What things you ask? things like automation, network, security, monitoring, logging, cloud, full-stack developing, and everything in between.

I am originally from New York, but I moved to San Francisco in 2015 because it makes sense to be here in you are an engineer in tech, and also the weather is great all year round!

I was once the first DevOps Engineer at a startup where I got the chance to build out the AWS infrastructure and code pipelines from the ground up. I got to wear many hats. I have also worked in medium and large sized companies where my focus was more specific.

I am currently at [Udemy](https://udemy.com), where I get to work with cool tech like Kubernetes, Django, Terraform, Ansible, Datadog etc. 

Certifications that I have achieved:
- AWS Certified Developer - Associate
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate
- Red Hat Certified Systems Adminisator (RHCSA)
- Certified Meraki Network Operator

In general, I just love learning new things!

My hobbies include playing video games (mostly Apex Legends and Fifa), watching sports, playing basketball, and being an assistant to my two french bulldogs. I'm also a nerd that loves Star Wars, LoTR, and Harry Potter. My favorite show is Mr. Robot.
