I am a Site Reliability Engineer with over 10 years of experience doing many different things & solving many complex problems. What things you ask? Things like automation, network, security, monitoring, logging, cloud, full-stack developing, and everything in between.

I was once the first DevOps Engineer at a startup where I got the chance to build out the entire infrastructure and build pipelines in AWS. I got a chance to wear many hats. I have also worked in medium and large sized companies where my focus was more specific.

I am currently at [Udemy](https://udemy.com), where I get to work with awesome tech like Kubernetes, Helm, Skaffold, Terraform, Ansible, and more. 

Certifications that I have achieved:
- AWS Certified Developer - Associate
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate
- Red Hat Certified Systems Adminisator (RHCSA)
- Certified Meraki Network Operator

I love learning new things.

My hobbies include coding, playing video games, watching sports, and hanging out with my two french bulldogs. 

My favorite shows are Mr. Robot, Silicon Valley & Community.
