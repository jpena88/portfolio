      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I am a Site Reliability Engineer with over 10 years of experience doing lots of different things &amp; solving many complex problems. What things you ask? Things like automation, network, security, monitoring, logging, cloud, full-stack developing, and everything in between.</p>
<p>I was once the first DevOps Engineer at a startup where I got the chance to build out the AWS infrastructure and code pipelines from the ground up. I got to wear many hats. I have also worked in medium and large sized companies where my focus was more specific.</p>
<p>I am currently at <a href="https://udemy.com">Udemy</a>, where I get to work with cool tech like Kubernetes, Django, Terraform, Ansible, Datadog etc.</p>
<p>Certifications that I have achieved:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Certified Developer - Associate</li>
<li>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate</li>
<li>Red Hat Certified Systems Adminisator (RHCSA)</li>
<li>Certified Meraki Network Operator</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, I love to learn new things.</p>
<p>My hobbies include playing video games (mostly Apex Legends and Fifa), watching sports, playing basketball, and being an assistant to my two french bulldogs. I'm also a nerd that loves Star Wars, LoTR, and Harry Potter. My favorite show is Mr. Robot.</p>
